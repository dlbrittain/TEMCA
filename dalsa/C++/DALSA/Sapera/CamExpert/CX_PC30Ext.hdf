This dialog allows you to choose the Exposure mode. Enter the required values directly in the fields displayed in the dialog. There are five exposure modes: • #STYLE_REF<BOLD>Internal SYNC, internal PRIN#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>: This  mode allows you to program the line period, in µs, as well as individual exposure times for each color. If you set an exposure time longer than the line period, the line period is automatically adjusted (sem 2).• #STYLE_REF<BOLD>EXSYNC, maximum IT#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>: This mode uses an external trigger (EXSYNC on CC1) to initiate the acquisition. All colors use the maximum exposure time available between triggers (sem 3). The user sets the exposure time in µs.• #STYLE_REF<BOLD>Smart EXSYNC#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>: This mode uses a Smart EXSYNC trigger (EXSYNC on CC1). A rising EXSYNC starts integration for all colors, and a falling EXSYNC begins the readout (sem 4). The user sets both the exposure time, in µs, and the line frequency in Hz. • #STYLE_REF<BOLD>EXSYNC, internal PRIN#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>: This mode uses an external trigger (EXSYNC on CC1) to initiate the acquisition on the falling edge, each color can have its own exposure time, and the end of the longest exposure time among the colors starts the readout (sem 6). The user sets the exposure times for each color, in µs, and the line frequency in Hz. The line period must exceed the longest exposure time.• #STYLE_REF<BOLD>Internal SYNC, maximum IT#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>: A user specifed line period is used. Each color uses the maximum exposure time permitted for the line rate (sem 7). The user sets the exposure time in µs.#STYLE_REF<BOLD>High Speed Control Input Signal Definitions#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD> #STYLE_REF<BOLD>IT#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>: Integration Time. The length of time that the sensor is exposed and photons are collected. Can also be referred to as exposure time or shutter speed (however, most digital cameras do not use an actual shutter).#STYLE_REF<BOLD>SYNC#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>: Synchronization. Timing pulses that are generated to identify when a line is to be acquired. Internal sync allows the user to define the line rate. External sync uses a trigger to initiate the line acquisition.#STYLE_REF<BOLD>EXSYNC#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>: External Synchronization. This is an input signal used to control the readout rate. The high to low transition causes the readout to begin. Some cameras may offer a "Smart EXSYNC" where the integration time is encoded into the high time of the EXSYNC signal. Readout begins on the falling edge of EXSYNC as before. Readout automatically begins after the integration time is complete. #STYLE_REF<BOLD>PRIN#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>:   Pixel Reset and Integration. The PRIN signal allows a camera's exposure time to be different from its line/frame rate. When PRIN is logic HIGH, the camera collects (integrates) light. When PRIN is brought to logic LOW, the charge in the camera's pixels is discarded (the pixels are reset). Remember that a timing relationship to EXSYNC, camera dependent, must be maintained. The PRIN signal must be held a minimum time after the EXSYNC to avoid losing the integrated charge.#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Camera Control Signals#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>CC1 (EXSYNC/Blue PR)	CC2 (Green PR)CC3 (CCD Direction)CC4 (Spare/Red PR)#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Refer to command descriptions in Piranha manual#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>semssfset #END_TOPIC#TOPIC_ID<4100000d>Click Setting… to open the Manual Gain & Offset dialog.
