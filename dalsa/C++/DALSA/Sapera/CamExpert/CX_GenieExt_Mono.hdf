In most situations, use the largest possible packet size supported by your network elements.

The Image timeout value is the amount of time the GigE server will wait for an image to be transferred from the camera to the host buffer memory. If the image timeout expires, the current buffer’s contents will be incomplete and the Sapera buffer state is set to StateOverflow.By default this value is greater than (and must be greater than) the time required to receive a complete frame. The time required may depend on the number of Genie cameras connected to the NIC and whether they transmit frames simultaneously. If the timeout period is too short, data will be trashed and packet resend commands will be issued.
