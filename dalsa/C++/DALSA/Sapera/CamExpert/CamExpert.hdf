Fast, but tends to smooth the edges of the image.Method 2Advanced technique; better for preserving image edges. However, it works well only when the image has a strong content in green. Otherwise, little amounts of noise may be visible within objects.Method 3Advanced technique; almost as good as Method 2 for preserving edges, but independent of the image content in green. Small color artifacts of 1 pixel may be visible at the edges.	#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Refer to Sapera  Parameter#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>CORACQ_PRM_BAYER_DECODER_METHOD#END_TOPIC#TOPIC_ID<28690004>#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Bayer Blue Gain#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>Bayer Decoder White Balance Gain for the red channel.#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Refer to Sapera  Parameter#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>CORACQ_PRM_BAYER_DECODER_WB_GAIN_RED#END_TOPIC#TOPIC_ID<286a0004>#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Bayer Blue Gain#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>Bayer Decoder White Balance Gain for the green channel.#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Refer to Sapera  Parameter#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>CORACQ_PRM_BAYER_DECODER_WB_GAIN_GREEN#END_TOPIC#TOPIC_ID<286b0004>#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Bayer Blue Gain#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>Bayer Decoder White Balance Gain for the blue channel.#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Refer to Sapera  Parameter#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>CORACQ_PRM_BAYER_DECODER_WB_GAIN_BLUE#END_TOPIC#TOPIC_ID<286c0004>#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Bayer Red Offset#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>Bayer Decoder White Balance Offset for the red channel.#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Refer to Sapera  Parameter#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>CORACQ_PRM_BAYER_DECODER_ENABLE#END_TOPIC#TOPIC_ID<286d0004>#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Bayer Green Offset#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>Bayer Decoder White Balance Offset for the green channel.#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Refer to Sapera  Parameter#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>CORACQ_PRM_BAYER_DECODER_ENABLE#END_TOPIC#TOPIC_ID<286e0004>#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Bayer Blue Offset#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>Bayer Decoder White Balance Offset for the blue channel.#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Refer to Sapera  Parameter#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>CORACQ_PRM_BAYER_DECODER_ENABLE#END_TOPIC#TOPIC_ID<103f9>Displays all acquisition devices installed and available in the system. After selecting an acquisition device, use the [+] and [-] buttons to toggle the display of the available acquisition servers supported by the device. A server can be considered as an operational mode supported by the device that determines how to communicate with Sapera software. When an acquisition server is selected, CamExpert will only present acquisition and camera parameters supported by the selected device.Right-clicking on the Image Viewer icon allows you to open an image file, or save the currently loaded image. Supported file types are: BMP (*.bmp), TIF (*.tif), CORECO (*.crc), RAW (*.raw), JPEG (*.jpg), and JPEG 2000 (*.jp2).#END_TOPIC#TOPIC_ID<103fa>Initiates live grab from the camera using the current parameter settings. Click again to stop (freeze) live grab mode.The display window shows the camera image as transferred to the frame buffer. The CamExpert display window can be resized or its scroll bars (if present) allow for viewing any portion of the live image.During live grab you can modify acquisition or camera parameter values. Some of the changes take effect immediately. Other changes will take effect only after you stop the grab and then restart it again.

First aim the camera at a flat white area and adjust the exposure to not saturate the image. Then with the computer mouse, click and drag open a rectangular area (ROI) within the flat white area. Click the auto white balance button.
