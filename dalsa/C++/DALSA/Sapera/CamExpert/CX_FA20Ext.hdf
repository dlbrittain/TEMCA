This dialog allows you to choose the Exposure mode. Enter the required values directly in the fields displayed in the dialog. There are 4 exposure modes: • #STYLE_REF<BOLD>Internal SYNC, Internal integration#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>: (sem 2) This mode allows you to program the frame period, in µs. If you set an exposure time longer than the frame period, the frame period is automatically adjusted.• #STYLE_REF<BOLD>External SYNC, Internal integration#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>: (sem 6) This mode uses an external trigger (EXSYNC on CC1) to initiate the exposure on the rising edge. The user sets the exposure time, in µs, and the frame frequency in Hz. The frame period must exceed the exposure time. • #STYLE_REF<BOLD>Smart External SYNC#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>: (sem 4) This mode uses a Smart EXSYNC trigger (EXSYNC on CC1). A rising EXSYNC starts integration for all colors, and a falling EXSYNC begins the readout. The user sets both the exposure time, in µs, and the line frequency in Hz. • #STYLE_REF<BOLD>Sequential Smart EXSYNC:#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD> (sem(9) The rising edge of the EXSYNC marks the beginning of the exposure and the falling edge initiates readout. There is a 100 us delay between the trigger and the start of the exposure.#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Refer to command description in Falcon manual#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>sem #END_TOPIC#TOPIC_ID<41000011>#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Enable Flat Field Correction#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>Enables or disables FPN and PRNU coefficients for flat field correction.#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Possible values#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>DisabledEnable FPN OnlyEnable PRNU OnlyEnable FPN and PRNU	#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Refer to command description in Falcon manual#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>epc #END_TOPIC#TOPIC_ID<41000012>#STYLE_REF<BOLD>Flat Field Correction#END_STYLE_REF<BOLD>The Flat Field Correction Wizard performs flat field calibration to correct for variations in the camera's sensor.
